Jarvis AI Voice Assistant - Project Report

Overview:
This is a voice-based AI assistant developed in Python that integrates local speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities with an AI 
backend using the Ollama language model. It listens for a wake word and then performs actions or answers questions.

Key Features:
- Voice-activated with wake word: "Jarvis" (customizable)
- Can open websites like Google, Facebook, YouTube
- Can play predefined songs via YouTube links
- Fetches and reads top news using News API
- Integrates with Ollama (local language model) for general questions
- Graceful termination with voice command ("close the function")

Technologies Used:
- Python
- speech_recognition (for voice input)
- pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)
- webbrowser (to open URLs)
- requests (to fetch news)
- dotenv (for securing API keys)
- Ollama (local AI model for chat)

Security Improvements:
- API keys are now stored securely in a `.env` file and not hardcoded
- `.env` is ignored by Git using `.gitignore`

GitHub Repository:
The project is publicly available on GitHub, version controlled for updates, and can serve as a portfolio piece.

Future Suggestions:
- Add GUI interface for accessibility
- Add support for more commands (system-level, app-launching)
- Fine-tune or replace Ollama model for faster responses
